/* Data files for CADR Lisp machines were apparently stored as 32 bits
   left aligned in a 36-bit word.  The 32-bit word is in PDP-11 endian
   format, i.e. 16-bit words are little endian but the most
   significant 16-bit word comes before the least significant.  Maybe
   this is a legacy from the CONS machine which was attached to the AI
   lab PDP-10 through Unibus. */
